# Data Storage

Each project in SRE has three storage folders.  

(i) Shared read-write: Workspace where everybody on the project has full access (edit/move/copy/delete). Everyone in the project can read-write in this folder. 

(ii) Shared read-only: A place where the data custodian can place data sets that are not to be changed by project team members. Data custodians have read-write access here and everybody else have read-only access. 

(ii) Personal: Each project team member has a personal folder in the SRE project where they have read-write privileges. Under personal folder there are two folders - Ingress and Egress. The data custodians access these folders to move in the requested files as part of data ingress or egress process. 

Please note that the data custodians have read-write access to the Researcher's personal folder in SRE.
