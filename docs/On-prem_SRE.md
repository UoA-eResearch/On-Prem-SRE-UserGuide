#On Premise (On-prem) SRE 

The On-prem SRE is built on our local Nectar infrastructure. Each environment consists of a set of modules/components that provide analytics (computation), data storage, access control, multi-tiered security, and a governance model in accordance with regulatory/project requirements. 

Every project in SRE is isolated from each other, as well as from the internet and the rest of the university services (e.g., no direct access to UniFiles) except where needed (e.g., Single Sign On, patching, etc.).
